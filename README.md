The goal of my individuale final project was producing a high quality 3D reconstruction of an object from
a collection of structured light scans. A set of scans from the provided google drive was utilized for
calibration, reconstruction and creation of a set of meshes. Each mesh was smoothed using a simple
smoothing algorithm, then was aligned using meshlab. The final model was reconstructed using poisson
reconstruction.
